## About Me

I live and work in Saint Petersburg. I take responsibility for my work. I quickly master new areas of activity, master new skills.

Why Frontend?

Reason 1 - the relevance of the profession
JavaScript has been at the top of programming languages for several years now. It is logical and simple, it is easy to master it without technical knowledge. Smart devices and applications are used by almost every person, and the interface for them is created by a front-end developer.

Reason 2 - you see the result immediately
It's nice to write code when you understand the result better. Yes, and it turns out to be proud of the work clearly: “I made this website, came up with buttons and animation.”

## Skills

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Sass/Less
4. JavaScript (Basik)
5. Gulp
6. Git, GitHub

## Code Example
### CODEWARS Task

The first argument to your search function will be a number which represents your budget.

The second argument will be an array of coffee bean prices.

Your 'search' function should return the stores that sell coffee within your budget.

The search function should return a string of prices for the coffees beans you can afford. The prices in this string are to be sorted in ascending order.

```
function search(budget, prices) {
  let coffeeShop = [];
  prices.map((it) => {
    if(budget >= it) {
      return coffeeShop.push(it);
    }
  });

  return coffeeShop.sort(function(a, b){return a - b}).join(',');
}
```
